//! One measurement context per take (#294): the take opened once, with
//! its settings, clock, breaks and masks, each sound file's place on the
//! take's timeline and each session entry's window, all in take seconds.
//!
//! A take's sound files are read end to end as one recording, so a time
//! in the take is a time in its sound counted from the first file's
//! start. Each entry of its session file names a recording (one of the
//! files, or the take's folder) and gives its stretch in seconds into
//! that recording; here every such stretch is moved by its recording's
//! offset, so every surface reads the same windows, cuts and masks.
//!
//! This first step builds the context; no surface reads it yet.
